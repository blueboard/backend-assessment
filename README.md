# Backend Project

## Description
Design an web API endpoint using whatever web framework you're most comfortable with. Create a single API endpoint that allows users to interact with the data in `data.json`.

## Requirements

- Accepts JSON requests
- Allows querying, filtering, and pagination of objects
- Allows creating, updating, editing, and deleting data (persist to `data.json`)
- Please comment and style your code as you would for code that needs to be maintained

## Data

Thanks for taking the time to do this assessment project! In the `data.json` file, you will find a Javascript array that will serve as your data source.

## Deliverables

- Send a zip/tarball or github link of all your code to the assessor
- In your email, describe how you would implement an realtime events endpoint that a developer could get data updates from.
